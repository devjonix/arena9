# Arena 9

Arena 9 is a camera setup for fly walking experiments.
It currently consists of three modules

- Top: Mounting for a camera and LEDs
- Middle: The actual arena (9 cm diam) and its holder
- Bottom: A lift mechanism

The arena is still under development and parts may change
(as of July 2024).


## Function of each module

### Top

The top module creates distance to the arena and acts as a mounting point
for the camera.

The LED slots allow optogenetic stimulation and
illumination of the flies.


### Middle

Contains the actual arena and its holder.
The arena slides out for easy fly loading and unloading.

The floor and ceiling are acrylic glass sheets.

### Bottom

#### A) Lift (optional)

The bottom has a elevator mechanism for moving the arena up and
down. This is needed when using a video projector and a back-projection screen to adjust the distance to the screen.

Sanded or somehow else mattefied acrylic glass sheet can act
as the back-projection screen.


## DIY manufacturing

The arena is mostly 3D printable and requires only a minimal
set of additional parts. You will need

- Any FDM 3D printer
- About 1 kg of PET-G, PLA or other filament

Tested with 0.2 mm layer height, 0.4 mm nozzle and slicer
default settings. Parts do not require supports.
Brims or rafts can be used if needed for good bed adhesion.

Required, non-printable parts

- Many M3 hex-socket screws, length 8 mm
- 3x 95 x 95 x 2 mm acrylic glass

Screw holes have tight tolerances so that the M3 screws
essentially drill in.

Yet unfixed components

- USB camera for video capture (fly tracking)
- Light sources for illumination and optogenetic activation
- A digital video projector for displaying images to the flies

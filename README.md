# Arena 9

Arena 9 is a research apparatus for fly walking experiments.
It currently consists of three parts

- Top: Mounting for a camera and LEDs
- Middle: The actual arena (9 cm diam) and its holder
- Bottom: A lift mechanism

Arena 9 is still under development, not ready for
production use (as of July 2024).


## Function of each part

### Top

The top part creates distance to the arena and acts as a mounting point
for the camera.

The LED slots allow optogenetic stimulation and
illumination of the flies.


### Middle

Contains the actual arena and its holder.
The arena slides out for easy fly loading and unloading.

Requires two pieces 95 mm x 95 mm x 2 mm acrylic glass for the
arena floor and the ceiling.


### Bottom

#### A) Lift (optional)

The bottom mainly has a elevator mechanism for moving the arena up and
down. This is mainly needed when using a video projector and a back-projection
screen to adjust the screen's distance to the flies.

Requires one piece of 95 mm x 95 mm x 2 mm acrylic glass for
the back-projection screen.
